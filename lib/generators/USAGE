Description:
    The webring generator creates the necessary structure for integrating webring
    functionality into your Rails application.

Example:
    rails generate webring:install

    This will create:
        config/initializers/webring.rb
        # And mount the Webring engine in your routes.rb file

Example:
    rails generate webring:member

    This will create:
        app/models/webring/member.rb
        db/migrate/TIMESTAMP_create_webring_members.rb
        # And add member routes to your routes.rb file

Example:
    rails generate webring:controller

    This will create:
        app/controllers/webring/navigation_controller.rb
        # And add navigation routes to your routes.rb file
