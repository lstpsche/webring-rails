==============================================
Webring Engine Has Been Successfully Installed!
==============================================

The Webring engine has been mounted at '/webring' in your application. Below are
the next steps to complete the webring setup and customization options.

1. Configure Your Members Model
-------------------------------
Generate a member model to store information about sites in your webring:

    $ rails generate webring:member

This will:
  - Create a Webring::Member model in app/models/webring/member.rb
  - Create a migration to set up the webring_members table
  - Add appropriate database indexes

After generating the model, run the migration:

    $ rails db:migrate

2. Generate Navigation Controller [Optional]
--------------------------------------------
Generate a navigation controller to handle navigation between webring members:

    $ rails generate webring:controller

This will:
  - Create the Webring::NavigationController in app/controllers/webring/navigation_controller.rb
  - Add navigation routes to your routes.rb file:
    - GET /webring/next     - Navigate to the next site
    - GET /webring/previous - Navigate to the previous site
    - GET /webring/random   - Navigate to a random site

3. Customize Your Routes [Optional]
----------------------------------
The engine is mounted at '/webring' by default. You can change this in your routes.rb file:

    # Original mount point
    mount Webring::Engine => '/webring', as: 'webring'

    # Example custom mount point
    mount Webring::Engine => '/network', as: 'webring'

4. Add Webring Navigation UI Elements
------------------------------------
Add navigation links to your views to enable users to navigate through the webring:

    <%= link_to 'Next Site', webring.next_path(source_member_uid: your_member.uid) %>
    <%= link_to 'Previous Site', webring.previous_path(source_member_uid: your_member.uid) %>
    <%= link_to 'Random Site', webring.random_path %>

Note: Replace 'your_member.uid' with the actual UID of your site in the webring.
      If you're building a standalone webring hub, you can omit the source_member_uid parameter.

5. Managing Webring Members
--------------------------
You can add members to your webring using the Webring::Member model:

    Webring::Member.create(name: 'Example Site', url: 'https://example.com')

Consider building an admin interface to manage your webring members.
