Webring has been installed successfully! Next steps:

1. Configure Your Models
------------------------
Generate a member model:
    rails generate webring:member

This will create a Webring::Member model, migration, and add members routes to your routes.rb file.
You can remove added routes (they will still work), or you can wrap them in some access control.

2. Generate Navigation Controller [optional customization]
----------------------------------------------------------
Generate a navigation controller:
    rails generate webring:controller

This will create the Webring::NavigationController and add its routes to your routes.rb file.

3. Update Your Routes [optional customization]
----------------------------------------------
The engine is mounted at /webring. You can change this in your routes.rb file.

4. Add UI Elements
------------------
Add navigation links to your views to navigate through the webring:

<%= link_to 'Next', webring.next_path %>
<%= link_to 'Previous', webring.previous_path %>
<%= link_to 'Random', webring.random_path %>
