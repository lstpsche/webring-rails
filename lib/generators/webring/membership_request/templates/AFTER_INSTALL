==============================================
Webring::MembershipRequest Model Has Been Generated!
==============================================

The MembershipRequest model is the core component for handling new site requests to join your webring. Follow these steps to complete the setup:

1. Run Database Migration
------------------------
Apply the migration to create the webring_membership_requests table:

    $ rails db:migrate

2. Review and Customize the Model
-------------------------------
The generated model is located at:
    app/models/webring/membership_request.rb

The MembershipRequest model has the following attributes:
  - name: The name of the requesting site (required)
  - url: The URL of the requesting site (required)
  - callback_email: The email address to send notifications to (required)
  - description: The description of the requesting site (required)
  - status: The status of the request (pending, approved, rejected)

3. Generate Controller [Optional]
--------------------------------
Generate a controller to handle membership requests:

    $ rails generate webring:controller:membership_requests

This will:
  - Create the Webring::MembershipRequestsController in app/controllers/webring/membership_requests_controller.rb
  - Add membership request routes to your routes.rb file:
    - GET /webring/membership_requests/new - Renders the view for submitting a new membership request (view is your responsibility)
    - POST /webring/membership_requests    - Creates a new membership request

4. Managing Membership Requests
-------------------------------
You can manage membership requests using the Webring::MembershipRequest model:

    Webring::MembershipRequest.create(name: 'Example Site', url: 'https://example.com', description: 'Example description', callback_email: 'example@example.com')
