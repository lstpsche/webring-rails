==============================================
Webring::Member Model Has Been Generated!
==============================================

The Member model is the core component of the webring, representing each site
in your webring network. Follow these steps to complete the setup:

1. Run Database Migration
------------------------
Apply the migration to create the webring_members table:

    $ rails db:migrate

2. Review and Customize the Model
-------------------------------
The generated model is located at:
    app/models/webring/member.rb

The Member model has the following attributes:
  - uid: A unique identifier automatically generated for each member (32-character hex)
  - name: The name of the member site (required)
  - url: The URL of the member site (required)
  - description: The description of the member site (required)

3. Adding Members to Your Webring
-------------------------------
You can add members to your webring using the Webring::Member model:

    Webring::Member.create(name: 'Example Site', url: 'https://example.com', description: 'Example description')

The uid will be automatically generated if not provided. It is recommended to leave the UID generation to the model.
